# Unity Kataru Demo

## About
Pretty big Unity starter project with Kataru submodule. Tested on 2021.1.9f1. 
Topdown 2D but I imagine it's pretty easy to convert it to another style.
Kataru yml files located in Assets/Kataru/Editor.

Contains:
- Scene loading framework
- Dialogue UI framework
- Basic AudioMixer setup
- Camera stacking
- Basic player control
- Settings/rebinding controls
- A ton of Kataru commands

As well as the following third party packages:
- Input System
- URP 2D Renderer
- Post Processing
- Cinemachine
- TextMeshPro
- NaughtyAttributes
- Hierarchy2
- Rotary Heart Serialized Dictionary
- SuperUnityBuild
- DOTween
- Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity

Cool misc features:
- Wiggly dialogue text
- Bubble stays on screen when character goes off screen
- Voice blips
- Customizable bubble depending on character


You can test out Windows, Mac and Linux builds [here](). Note that Kataru is not ready for WebGL yet.
